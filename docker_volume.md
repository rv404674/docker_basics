# Why docker volume?
Volumes are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.

Decoupling container from storage.
Share volume (storage/data) among different containers.
Attach volume to a container.
On deleting container, volume doesn't gets deleted.

> Note - Docker has two options, for containers to store files in the host system.
Volumes and bind mounts.


## Create/List/Inspect/Delete Vol

```bash
docker volume create myvol1
docker volume list
docker volume inspect myvol1
docker volume prune
```

## Volumes

1. Volumes are managed by docker and are isolated from the core functionality of the 
host machine.
2. A given volume can be mounted into multiple containers simultaneously.

```bash
docker run --name myjenkins1 -v myvol1:/var/jenkins_home -p 9090:8080 jenkins
```

Run the same command as above. Just change the name to "myjenkins2" and port.

```bash
docker run --name myjenkins2 -v myvol1:/var/jenkins_home -p 9091:8080 jenkins
```

> Note - you will be able to see the jobs (which were created in the first container), in the second container.

## Bind Mounts

Bind Mount - A file or dir on host machine, is mounted into a container.
(basically you can use physical location instead of volumes)

```bash
docker run --name myjenkins3 -v /Users/home/jenkins_temp:/var/jenkins_home/ -p 9092:8080 jenkins
```

 > Note - "/Users/home/jenkins_temp", will be automatically created, if you don't already have it.
