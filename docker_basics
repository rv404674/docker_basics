Q1. Stable vs Edge Version
Ans Edge provides an installer with new features, but it is not necessarily fully tested. Edge is sort of the beta one.

Q2. What id Docker app (docker.app)
Ans Docker.app is the Docker Desktop on Mac. It bundles the Docker client and Docker Desktop. It uses the macOS Hypervisor.framework to run containers, which means that a separate VirtualBox is not required to run Docker Desktop.
